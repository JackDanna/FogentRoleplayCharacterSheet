Maybes:

- Hardcore weapons
-- Martial skills: Small bladed, Medium Sword, ect...
-- Spell skills: Skills per spell?

- Casul mode
-- Martial Skill: Small Melee, Medium Melee
-- Spell Skills: Blazecraft, ect...

(Doesn't this already work?) Add know vocation skills so that baseDiceTierMods can be created for them

Combat Rolls can consume muliple weapon resources

Magic Combat Skills need resource used

Should only show dual weilded if two one handed weapons

hide twohanded if dice pool is the same as one handed

Magic Skill data should maybe live on magic Skill
